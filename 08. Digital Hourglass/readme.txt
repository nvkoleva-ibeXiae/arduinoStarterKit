The "Digital Hourglass" utilizes the millis() function to count the time the Arduino has been on and perform functions. In this case, an LED is turned on after a certain interval of time has passed. If the board is moved/shifted at any time, a tilt switch recognizes this and restarts the counting, similar to a traditional hourglass. If the board is not moved and all LEDs are on, they will remain in this state, as no other state has been configured at this time. The current interval is set to 5s, for ease of demonstration.
